# Diagrams

These diagrams are representations of the Mirror class hierarchy of [dart:mirrors](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.13.4/dart-mirrors/dart-mirrors-library.html#classes) and this package's DartElement class hierarchy.

Note that since all these structures are read-only, getters are considered fields. Also, methods were ignored, as well as mirrors that are not relevant for architecture testing (for instance, IsolateMirror).
